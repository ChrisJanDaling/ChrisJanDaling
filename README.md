## 🧭 About me
- 🎓 Mechanical Engineering student at UVic (co-op track)
- 🛠️ I love building things end-to-end: CAD → fabrication → electronics → testing
- 🌊 Current obsession: designing and riding an electric hydrofoil (e-foil)
- 🧪 Interests: power electronics, composites, battery packs, simulation, and DFM
- 💬 Ask me about: FreeCAD/SolidWorks workflows, 3D printing, and DIY e-mobility

---

## 🧰 Toolbox
**CAD:** SolidWorks, FreeCAD  
**Fabrication:** 3D printing (PLA/PETG/TPU), basic CNC, composites (fiberglass/carbon)  
**Electronics:** Li-ion packs (spot-welding, BMS wiring), ESCs, waterproofing/IP ratings  
**Software:** C/C++, MATLAB, Python basics, Git/GitHub  
**Other:** Project scoping, cost breakdowns, test plans, documentation

---

## 🚀 What I’m working on
- Finalizing the e-foil’s motor mount and waterproof hatch designs  
- Optimizing a 16S Li-ion battery pack with BMS & safe interconnects  
- Cleaning up CAD and releasing printable/DFM variants for community use

## 📌 Featured project: E-foil build
> Full write-up with photos, CAD, BOM, and test notes.

- **Overview:** Custom board, 16S Li-ion pack, waterproof inrunner motor, high-current ESC  
- **Highlights:**  
  - 16S battery architecture with BMS, fuse & harnessing best-practices  
  - Composite board (multi-layer fiberglass/carbon) with integrated hatches  
  - Motor pod + mast clamp, designed for sealing & serviceability  
- **Repo:** _Add link here once public (e.g., `/efoil-build`)_  
- **Docs quick links:**  
  - `/docs/BOM.md` – Bill of Materials  
  - `/docs/Wiring.md` – BMS/ESC wiring & safety notes  
  - `/cad/` – SolidWorks & STEP exports  
  - `/analysis/` – Power, range & buoyancy calcs
