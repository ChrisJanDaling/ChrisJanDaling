## 🧭 About me
- 🎓 Mechanical Engineering student at UVic (co-op track)
- 🛠️ I love building things end-to-end: CAD → fabrication → electronics → testing
- 🌊 Current project: Testing/finalising and riding an electric hydrofoil (e-foil)
- 🧪 Interests: Mechanical design, electronics, composites, battery packs and simulation


---

## 🧰 Toolbox
**CAD:** SolidWorks, FreeCAD  
**Fabrication:** 3D printing (PLA/PETG/TPU), basic CNC, composites (fiberglass/carbon)  
**Electronics:** Li-ion packs (spot-welding, soldering, wiring), ESCs, waterproofing.  
**Software:** C/C++, MATLAB, Python basics, Git/GitHub  
**Other:** Project scoping, cost breakdowns, test plans, documentation

---

## 🚀 What I’m working on
- Final Testing on efoil project   
- Optimizing battery pack with BMS & safe interconnects  
- Cleaning up and optimizing CAD models to be able to release printable variants for community use

## 📌 Featured project: E-foil build
> Full write-up with photos, CAD, BOM, and test notes.

- **Overview:** Custom board, 16S Li-ion pack, waterproof inrunner motor, high-current ESC  
- **Highlights:**  
  - 16S battery architecture with BMS following industry standard practices.  
  - Composite board (multi-layer fiberglass) with integrated hatches  
  - Motor pod + mast clamp, designed for sealing & serviceability  
- **Repo:**  https://github.com/ChrisJanDaling/ChrisJanDaling/blob/main/_projects/efoil.md 
- **Docs quick links:**  
  - `/docs/BOM.md` – Bill of Materials  
  - `/docs/Wiring.md` – BMS/ESC wiring & safety notes  
  - `/cad/` – SolidWorks & STEP exports  
  - `/analysis/` – Power, range & buoyancy calcs
